**RSA Factoring Challenge:**

RSA Factoring Challenge involved a computational task of factoring a provided RSA modulus into its two prime factors. Initiated in 1991 and conclude  in 2007, this challenge presented various RSA moduli with increasing bit lengths to the public, encouraging them to attempt the factorization proces

**Challenge Information:**

The RSA Factoring Challenge moduli were represented in decimal format and comprised of a semiprime, which was the result of multiplying two prime numbers together. The primary objective of the challenge was to factorize the given semiprime and identify its two prime factors. The moduli were denoted using a specific naming convention, such as "RSA-2048-1," indicating that it was the first challenge and the semiprime had a length of 2048 bits. The semiprime values were initially expressed in hexadecimal format.

**Taking part:**

The RSA Factoring Challenge, although no longer active, holds significant importance as a benchmark for assessing the security of RSA and other public-key encryption algorithms. While all the published moduli have been successfully factored, the challenge's historical impact endures. It serves as a reminder of the ongoing need to advance cryptographic techniques and ensure the robustness of encryption algorithms in the face of evolving computational capabilities. The RSA Factoring Challenge continues to inform research and development efforts aimed at strengthening the security of public-key encryption systems.
